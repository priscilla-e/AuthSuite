I learnt this from a youtube creator.

Here's a link to the original tutorial on youtube:   
[NextAuth Course - Complete Authentication with Credentials, Goo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Fs0NO78X8)

FYI they use the Next.js pages router in their tutorial so might be a bit from what you see on this repo.
